Use intrusion forensic techniques to study memory resident infections
Correct Answer: 1

12. During a computer hacking forensic investigation, an investigator is tasked with acquiring volatile data from a live Linux system with limited physical access. Which methodology would be the most suitable for this scenario? *

The investigator should use the Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer on the forensic workstation, then remotely execute the tool on the suspect machine to acquire the RAM image
The investigator should initiate a listening session on the forensic workstation using 'netcat', then execute a 'dd' command on the suspect machine and pipe the output using 'netcat'
The investigator should leverage OSXPMem to remotely parse the physical memory in the Linux machine and create AFF4 format images for analysis
The investigator should employ the LiME tool and 'netcat', starting a listening session using tcp:port on the suspect machine and then establishing a connection from the forensic workstation using 'netcat'
Correct Answer: 4
