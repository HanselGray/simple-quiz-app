Q13. While working as an intern for a small business, you have been tasked with managing the company's web server. The server is being bombarded with requests, and the company's website is intermittently going offline. You suspect that this could be a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. As an ethical hacker, which of the following steps would be your first course of action to mitigate the issue? * 
Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for assistance
Install a newer version of the server software
Implement IP address whitelisting

Correct Answer: 1

Q14. A sophisticated attacker targets your web server with the intent to execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. His strategy involves a unique mixture of TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, using 'r' packets per second. Your server, reinforced with advanced security measures, can handle 'h' packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If 'r' surpasses 'h', it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive. In a peculiar pattern, the attacker selects 'r' as a composite number and 'h' as a prime number, making attack detection more challenging. Considering 'r = 2010' and different values for 'h', which of the following scenarios would potentially cause the server to falter? * 
h = 1987 (prime): The attacker's packet rate exceeds the server's capacity, causing potential unresponsiveness
h = 1999 (prime): Despite the attacker's packet flood, the server can handle these requests, remaining responsive
h = 1993 (prime): Despite being less than 'r', the server's prime number capacity keeps it barely operational, but the risk of failure is imminent
h = 2003 (prime): The server can manage more packets than the attacker is sending; hence, it stays operational
Correct Answer: 1

Q16. A penetration tester was assigned to scan a large network range to find live hosts. The network is known for using strict TCP filtering rules on its firewall, which may obstruct common host discovery techniques. The tester needs a method that can bypass these firewall restrictions and accurately identify live systems. What host discovery technique should the tester use?
ICMP Timestamp Ping Scan
ICMP ECHO Ping Scan
TCP SYN Ping Scan
UDP Ping Scan
Correct Answer: 4

Q17. Your network infrastructure is under a SYN flood attack. The attacker has crafted an automated botnet to simultaneously send 's' SYN packets per second to the server. You have put measures in place to manage 'f' SYN packets per second, and the system is designed to handle this number without any performance issues. If 's' exceeds 'f', the network infrastructure begins to show signs of overload. The system's response time increases exponentially (2^k), where 'k' represents each additional SYN packet above the 'f' limit. Now, considering 's = 500' and different 'f' values, in which scenario is the server most likely to experience overload and significantly increased response times? * 
f = 510: The server can handle 510 SYN packets per second, which is greater than what the attacker is sending. The system remains stable, and the response time remains unaffected.
f = 495: The server can handle 495 SYN packets per second. The response time drastically rises (2^5 = 32 times the normal), indicating a probable system overload.
f = 505: The server can handle 505 SYN packets per second. In this case, the response time increases, but not as drastically (2^5 = 32 times the normal), and the system might still function, albeit slowly.
f = 490: The server can handle 490 SYN packets per second. With 's' exceeding 'f' by 10, the response time shoots up (2^10 = 1024 times the usual response time), indicating a system overload.
